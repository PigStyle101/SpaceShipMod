custom gui that uses space hub inventory, that way stuff is hidden

need to do: 
--fix dock final (not spawning entities)
--add check to takeoff to make sure platform is on its won surface
--change the gui captions to the ones in core/locale/en/core.cfg were viable
--fix planet indicator for stations

-create gui for making auto schedule.
--Add check to see if auto and if all conditions are met for the planets its planet_orbiting
--if both are true, launch ship into travel mode and start the schedule





storage.spaceship structure
{
    walls = {}--not used yet
    name = string
    id = int
    player = person who created it
    scanned = bool (need to scan to log ship info, should be fired any time the ship changes)
    player_in_cockpit = bool (for telling if ship is being manipulated by player or in auto)
    taking_off = bool (should be renamed to docking)
    own_surface = bool (check if ship is on its own surface before letting it do automatic stuff)
    hub = entity
    schedule = {name,schedule{base game}} (used for automation and saving info between docking)
    floor = {positions} (tile positions)
    entities = {entities} (we need this to clone all entities)(count be changed later to make it scan when docking/undocking if more efficient)
    referance_tile = {x,y} (pick first tile found when scanning to use for referance later)
    surface = LuaSurface
    planet_orbiting = string (need to know this for automation, could potentialy use surface to get it as well if more efficient.)
