custom gui that uses space hub inventory, that way stuff is hidden

need to do: -=important,--=less important
-add dock points (entity on ship and on platform that line up to each other?)(will need to offset the refernace tile?)
-set up logic for when ship reaches its destination to dock with station

--fix dock final (not spawning entities)
--add check to takeoff to make sure platform is on its own surface
--change the gui captions to the ones in core/locale/en/core.cfg were viable
--spell check





storage.spaceship structure
{
    walls = {}--not used yet
    name = string
    id = int
    player_owner = person who created it
    scanned = bool (need to scan to log ship info, should be fired any time the ship changes)
    player_in_cockpit = playerLua in cockpit
    taking_off = bool (should be renamed to docking)
    own_surface = bool (check if ship is on its own surface before letting it do automatic stuff)
    hub = entity
    schedule = {name,schedule{base game}} (used for automation and saving info between docking)
    floor = {positions} (tile positions)
    entities = {entities} (we need this to clone all entities)(count be changed later to make it scan when docking/undocking if more efficient)
    referance_tile = {x,y} (pick first tile found when scanning to use for referance later)
    surface = LuaSurface
    planet_orbiting = string (need to know this for automation, could potentialy use surface to get it as well if more efficient.)
